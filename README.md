# üó∫Ô∏è Welcome to our Challenge Roadmaps channel!

These roadmaps will help you gradually progress through various challenges based on your goals and skill level. It's not an exact science, so feel free to deviate from the roadmaps. But these are some paths we recommend üôÇ

If you're seeking help from the community, remember to ask for feedback whenever you submit your solutions on the platform. The more specific you are with your questions, the more likely you will receive helpful feedback.

## Getting started on Frontend Mentor (beginner)

üö® **We have now released a "[Getting started on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/getting-started-on-frontend-mentor-XJhRWRREZd)" learning path on the platform. We recommend using that instead of this roadmap.**

These projects will help you get started on the Frontend Mentor platform and give you experience working with designs and building small projects. They're all HTML & CSS-only challenges, so they'll help you learn the basics.

### Roadmap

1. [QR code component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H?ref=challenge-roadmap) (üÜì)
2. [3-column preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-?ref=challenge-roadmap) (üÜì)
3. [Single price grid component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc?ref=challenge-roadmap) (üÜì)
4. [Order summary component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj?ref=challenge-roadmap) (üÜì)
5. [Stats preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62?ref=challenge-roadmap) (üÜì)

### Next steps

Once you've completed this roadmap, an excellent next roadmap to work your way through is the ["Building responsive layouts (beginner)" roadmap](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1132431845573804042).

## Building responsive layouts (beginner)

üö® **We have now released a "[Building responsive layouts](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/building-responsive-layouts--z1qCXVqkD)" learning path on the platform. We recommend using that instead of this roadmap.**

A crucial part of modern front-end development is making web pages look good on various device sizes. We provide designs at 375px, 768px (premium challenges), and 1440px. Designers often use these sizes when designing layouts. However, as a developer, you must ensure layouts look good at all screen sizes. So be sure to test your projects on many device sizes. Tools like [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) can help you do this.

We recommend you build these projects [mobile-first](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/responsive-design/index.html#mobile-first-development). Working mobile-first means you will start with the mobile layout and adjust for larger screens. It's a typical workflow with professional front-end developers, so worth trying out and getting some practice.

### Prerequisites

To start this roadmap, you need at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. If you're an absolute beginner, we recommend trying out the ["Getting started on Frontend Mentor" roadmap](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1131872426364506282) first.

# Intro to JavaScript frameworks (beginner - intermediate)

This roadmap provides a guided sequence of projects to help you start practicing with JS frameworks. While working through these projects, you'll practice concepts like:

- Basic JavaScript syntax
- DOM Manipulation
- Component-based architecture
- Data Binding
- Routing and navigation
- State management
- Working with data (JSON and APIs)
- Build and deployment

## Prerequisites

We recommend a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before learning JavaScript frameworks. Understanding core JS concepts will ensure you grasp the underlying concepts that frameworks help abstract.

If you haven't done so already, please consider working through our ["JavaScript fundamentals (beginner)"](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1133822849770078338) roadmap using vanilla JavaScript.

# Intro to accessibility (beginner)

Accessibility spans all front-end languages and impacts how usable sites you create are to everyone who visits. Deep knowledge in this area will help you build better projects and is crucial to becoming a professional developer.

The challenges in this roadmap will help you practice the following concepts:

- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Multimedia and alternative text
- ARIA roles and attributes
- Accessible forms
- Responsive design
- Testing for accessibility

While building each project, test for [keyboard accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/) and use tools like [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) to run automated tests. Automated testing can only go so far, though. Go through [manual accessibility tests](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/test-manual/) to ensure you test each project comprehensively. Going through this process will give you an excellent grounding in the workflow of a professional developer.

## Prerequisites

Because accessibility spans HTML, CSS, and JS, we recommend you understand each language's fundamentals before working through this roadmap.

If you're completely new to web development, we recommend checking out the ["Getting started on Frontend Mentor"](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1131872426364506282), ["Building responsive layouts (beginner)"](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1132431845573804042), and ["JavaScript fundamentals (beginner)"](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1133822849770078338) roadmaps first.

We also recommend reading through the ["Learn Accessibility!" tutorial on web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/) to give you a solid grounding in accessibility fundamentals.
